                    <p>While the blue whale is the largest sea creature, the lion's mane jellyfish is at the top of the list of the longest ocean animals. These languid beauties have tentacles that reach an astonishing 120 feet in length. It's hard to know why they are graced with such extraordinary appendages. They are said to get tangled in marine debris or with other tentacles, and as they take notably more time to contract, they are more vulnerable to predators with a taste for jellyfish arms. That said, their long main of poison-equipped tentacles makes an excellent trap for prey.</p>

                    <p>Most of us have seen photos of a glorious, gigantic blue whale, but without something to show scale, it's hard to fathom how tremendous their size is. The blue whale is the largest animal known to have existed — even out-sizing dinosaurs. They weigh up to 441,000 pounds. Their hearts are the size of a car; their heartbeats can be detected from two miles away. At birth, they already rank amongst the largest full-grown animals. Because of commercial whaling, the species almost went extinct by the 20th century. Thankfully, it has slowly recovered following the global whaling ban. </p>

                    <p>At almost 80 feet in length, the beautiful sperm whale is the largest of the toothed whales and the largest toothed predator of all. If you placed it on its end and put it on the street, it would be as tall as an eight-story building. Its clicking call can be as loud as 230 decibels underwater, equivalent to 170 decibels on land— about the loudness of a rifle shot within a few feet of one's ear.6 It has the largest brain of any animal, tipping the scales at around 20 pounds."Brains". American Museum Of Natural History.Unfortunately for the sperm whale, they were fiercely hunted in the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries.</p>
